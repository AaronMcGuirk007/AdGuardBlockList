# adguardhome-filters
Hosts lists from Steven Black (https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), revised for usage with Adguard Home:

	cleaned-up from "localhost/broadcast" records;
	127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 replaced to ||;
	all extensions are left unmerged to use independently;
	sub-domains are removed if top-level domain presented;

Files are compatible with AdGuard Home DNS filtering.
